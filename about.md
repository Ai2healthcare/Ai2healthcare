#### Introduction

The Society of Artificial Intelligence Research (SAIR) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization established by leading scholars in artificial intelligence, biomedicine, and health sciences. Headquartered in the United States, SAIR aims to accelerate healthcare innovation through multidisciplinary collaboration and knowledge sharing. 

Our mission is to convene top minds in AI and life sciences to illuminate new pathways for improving human health. We host a weekly online seminar, AI2Health, where prominent researchers give public lectures on cutting-edge developments in AI-enabled medicine. Past presenters have hailed from institutions such as Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and more. 

Beyond Thought Leadership Programming, SAIR facilitates scientific discourse through conferences, workshops, and publications. We also provide various funding opportunities to support high-potential projects across research, education, and entrepreneurship. 

SAIR has built an engaged community of over 1,200 members and subscribers from industry, academia, and government who are passionate about using computational sciences to advance biomedicine and human health. We welcome all who share this passion to join our efforts to steward progress at the intersection of these important fields.
