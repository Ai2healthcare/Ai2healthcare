Abstract

Anomalies, also known as outliers, are defined as ``data instances that significantly deviate from the majority of data instances". Correspondingly, anomaly detection (AD) refers to the process of finding these anomalous data points out in a data-driven fashion, which has long been a fundamental problem in machine learning and has various real-world applications, including medical health, fraud detection, cybersecurity and video surveillance, etc. Though there has been tremendous success in anomaly detection using deep learning, current methods, e.g., autoencoder reconstruction-based methods, fail to excavate the data characteristics well and there exist performance bottlenecks in both visual data and tabular data anomaly detection. In this talk, I will introduce our proposed methods which seamlessly incorporate input perturbation techniques into models in unsupervised one-class anomaly detection task and video anomaly detection task for performance improvements.

Main Challenge in this filed

1, Lack of labeled data: Anomaly detection is often an unsupervised learning task, meaning that labeled anomalous instances are scarce or even completely absent. Without labeled data, it becomes challenging to train models to accurately identify anomalies.

2, Imbalanced data distribution: In many real-world datasets, anomalies are rare compared to normal instances, resulting in imbalanced data distributions. Traditional machine learning algorithms tend to be biased towards the majority class, making it harder to detect anomalies effectively.

3, Evolving and adaptive anomalies: Anomalies can change over time or adapt to the detection methods employed. This requires anomaly detection systems to be flexible and able to adapt to new and previously unseen anomalies.

4, High-dimensional and complex data: With the increasing availability of complex and high-dimensional data, such as images, videos, and sensor readings, anomaly detection becomes more challenging. Traditional methods may struggle to capture the underlying patterns and variations in such data.

5, Interpretability and explainability: Anomaly detection models should not only provide accurate predictions but also offer explanations for why a particular instance is considered anomalous. Interpreting and explaining the decisions made by anomaly detection models is crucial for building trust and facilitating decision-making in real-world applications.

6, Real-time and scalable anomaly detection: Many applications, such as cybersecurity and video surveillance, require real-time anomaly detection on large-scale data streams. Developing efficient and scalable algorithms that can process data in real-time is a significant challenge.
