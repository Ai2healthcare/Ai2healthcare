Dr. Chan Li

Dr. Chan Li is currently a graduate student in the PMI Laboratory of the School of Physics, Sun Yat-sen University. In the fall of 2023, she will go to the University of California, San Diego to study a Ph.D. in physics. The main research direction is based on physics-inspired deep learning models, using statistical physics methods to analyze the theoretical mechanisms of various neural computing, thereby improving its interpretability. Related work has been published in Physical Review Letters, Physical Review E, Physical Review Research and other journals.

We propose a mode decomposition learning that can interpret the weight matrices as a hierarchy of latent modes. The mode decomposition learning not only saves a significant large amount of training costs but also explains the network performance with the leading modes, displaying a striking piecewise power-law behavior. The modes specify a progressively compact latent space across the network hierarchy, making a more disentangled subspace compared to standard training. Our mode decomposition learning is also studied in an analytic online learning setting, which reveals multiple stages of learning dynamics with a continuous specialization of hidden nodes. Therefore the proposed mode decomposition learning points to a cheap and interpretable route towards the magical deep learning.
