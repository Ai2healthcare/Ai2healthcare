Due to the dominant position of deep learning (mostly deep neural networks) in various artificial intelligence applications, recently, ensemble learning based on deep neural networks (ensemble deep learning) has shown significant performances in improving the generalization of learning system. However, since modern deep neural networks usually have millions to billions of parameters, the time and space overheads for training multiple base deep learners and testing with the ensemble deep learner are far greater than that of traditional ensemble learning. Though several algorithms of fast ensemble deep learning have been proposed to promote the deployment of ensemble deep learning in some applications, further advances still need to be made for many applications in specific fields, where the developing time and computing resources are usually restricted or the data to be processed is of large dimensionality. An urgent problem needs to be solved is how to take the significant advantages of ensemble deep learning while reduce the required expenses so that many more applications in specific fields can benefit from it. For the alleviation of this problem, it is essential to know about how ensemble learning has developed under the era of deep learning. Thus, in this article, we present discussions focusing on data analyses of published works, methodologies, recent advances and unattainability of traditional ensemble learning and ensemble deep learning. We hope this article will be helpful to realize the intrinsic problems and technical challenges faced by future developments of ensemble learning under the era of deep learning.

Ensemble deep learning, which combines multiple deep neural networks, has emerged as a powerful approach for improving the generalization of learning systems. However, the large size of modern deep neural networks poses challenges in terms of training time and resource requirements for ensemble learning. Although some fast ensemble deep learning algorithms have been proposed, further advancements are needed to enable its widespread adoption in applications with limited resources or high-dimensional data. The aim is to reduce the expenses associated with ensemble deep learning while harnessing its benefits. This article focuses on the development of ensemble learning in the era of deep learning, including data analysis of published works, methodologies, recent advances, and the limitations of traditional ensemble learning and ensemble deep learning. By addressing these issues, we hope to shed light on the inherent problems and technical challenges that need to be overcome for future advancements in ensemble learning under the influence of deep learning.

A major challenge in the field of ensemble deep learning is the high computational and resource requirements. Modern deep neural networks often have millions or billions of parameters, which significantly increases the time and space overheads for training and testing multiple base deep learners within an ensemble. This poses a challenge for applications with limited computing resources or large-dimensional data. The development of efficient and scalable algorithms for ensemble deep learning is crucial to address this challenge and enable wider adoption of ensemble methods in specific fields where resources are restricted. Finding ways to reduce the computational burden while maintaining the advantages of ensemble deep learning remains an urgent problem to be solved.

由于深度学习（主要是深度神经网络）在各种人工智能应用中占据主导地位，最近基于深度神经网络的集成学习（集成深度学习）在提高学习系统的泛化性能方面表现出显著的效果。然而，由于现代深度神经网络通常具有数百万到数十亿个参数，与传统的集成学习相比，训练多个基础深度学习器并使用集成深度学习器进行测试所需的时间和空间开销要大得多。虽然已经提出了一些快速集成深度学习算法来推动集成深度学习在某些应用中的部署，但对于许多特定领域的应用来说，仍然需要进一步的进展，因为这些领域的开发时间和计算资源通常受限，或者要处理的数据具有较高的维度。一个迫切需要解决的问题是如何在减少所需费用的同时发挥集成深度学习的显著优势，以便更多的特定领域应用能从中受益。为了缓解这个问题，了解集成学习在深度学习时代的发展非常重要。因此，在本文中，我们提出了关于已发表作品的数据分析、方法论、最新进展以及传统集成学习和集成深度学习的局限性的讨论。我们希望这篇文章对于认识在深度学习时代下集成学习未来发展所面临的固有问题和技术挑战具有帮助。
