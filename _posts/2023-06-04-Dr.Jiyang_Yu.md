Dissecting molecular (re)wiring and underpinning hidden drivers within and between cells/systems toward clinical translation. Biological processes operate through molecular networks at the cellular level and cell–cell communication networks at the tissue/organ level. Deciphering the wiring and rewiring of these networks under normal and pathologic conditions is a fundamental goal of biomedical research. Our lab is focused on developing data-driven systems biology algorithms to integrate bulk, single-cell, and spatial omics data to decipher these (re)wiring events and hidden drivers underpinning biological processes in health and disease. Ultimately, we aim to translate the hidden driver discoveries into therapeutic targets, biomarkers, and combination therapies for cancer and other disorders.

Many signaling and other genes known as “hidden” drivers may not be genetically or epigenetically altered or differentially expressed at the mRNA or protein levels, but, rather, drive a phenotype such as tumorigenesis via post-translational modification or other mechanisms. However, conventional approaches based on genomics or differential expression are limited in exposing such hidden drivers. Here, we present a comprehensive algorithm and toolkit NetBID2 (data-driven network-based Bayesian inference of drivers, version 2), which reverse-engineers context-specific interactomes and integrates network activity inferred from large-scale multi-omics data, empowering the identification of hidden drivers that could not be detected by traditional analyses. NetBID2 has substantially re-engineered the previous prototype version by providing versatile data visualization and sophisticated statistical analyses, which strongly facilitate researchers for result interpretation through end-to-end multi-omics data analysis. We demonstrate the power of NetBID2 using three hidden driver examples. We deploy NetBID2 Viewer, Runner, and Cloud apps with 145 context-specific gene regulatory and signaling networks across normal tissues and paediatric and adult cancers to facilitate end-to-end analysis, real-time interactive visualization and cloud-based data sharing. NetBID2 is freely available at https://jyyulab.github.io/NetBID.

The paper introduces NetBID2, a comprehensive algorithm and toolkit designed to identify hidden drivers that play a role in phenotypes such as tumorigenesis through post-translational modification or other mechanisms. These drivers may not exhibit genetic or epigenetic alterations or show differential expression at the mRNA or protein levels, making them challenging to detect using conventional genomics or differential expression approaches.NetBID2 addresses this limitation by reverse-engineering context-specific interactomes and integrating network activity inferred from large-scale multi-omics data. It enables the identification of hidden drivers that would otherwise remain undetected. The toolkit has undergone significant improvements from its previous version, offering versatile data visualization and sophisticated statistical analyses. These enhancements greatly aid researchers in result interpretation through end-to-end multi-omics data analysis.The paper showcases the capabilities of NetBID2 through three examples of hidden drivers. To facilitate analysis, real-time interactive visualization, and cloud-based data sharing, the authors provide NetBID2 Viewer, Runner, and Cloud apps. These apps support 145 context-specific gene regulatory and signaling networks across normal tissues as well as pediatric and adult cancers. Users can access these resources to conduct end-to-end analysis, visualize results interactively, and share data via the cloud.The authors emphasize that NetBID2 is freely available to the research community at https://jyyulab.github.io/NetBID. By leveraging NetBID2, researchers can overcome the limitations of traditional analyses and gain insights into hidden drivers that contribute to complex phenotypes, enhancing our understanding of diseases like cancer and facilitating the development of targeted therapies.
