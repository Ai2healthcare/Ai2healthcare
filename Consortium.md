**SAIR Related Consortium Program (SRCP)**

**AI and Human Diseases Consortium (AIHDC)**

SAIR offers workshop and consortium opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students interested in gaining hands-on research experience in artificial intelligence and human genomics. Members will work closely with SAIR members on ongoing literature review publication at the frontiers of AI across areas like enhance our understanding the role of genomics/genetics on human diseases with the support from machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and more. The key mission for this workgroup will be publishing review papers to enhance the field.

**Mendelian Randomization Consortium (MRC)**

The Mendelian Randomization Consortium (MRC) is a collaboration of international academics focused on promoting and facilitating Mendelian randomization research globally. Mendelian randomization is an epidemiological technique that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer causal relationships between modifiable exposures and disease outcomes. The MRC was established in 2022 by a group of researchers interested in harnessing Mendelian randomization to understand causality in observational data. The consortium aims to bring together experts across disciplines to advance methods, provide training resources, share data, and disseminate research findings. Core goals include supporting novel Mendelian randomization methods, evolving guidelines and best practices, facilitating data sharing and meta-analyses, and translating findings to improve public health and clinical care. Key activities of the MRC include maintaining an online database of genetic variants suitable as instrumental variables, developing statistical software packages for Mendelian randomization analysis, hosting workshops and webinars, and publishing methodological and applied Mendelian randomization research. The consortium also engages with scientific journals to improve the appraisal and publication of Mendelian randomization studies. With over 50 members spanning population health sciences, genetics, statistics, and clinical medicine, the MRC represents a leading effort to harness Mendelian randomization for causal inference from observational data. The consortium provides an important platform to enhance methods, build capacity, and translate findings in this rapidly evolving field.
